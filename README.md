# EMC-PROJECTGreat! If you have only **2 pages** (like a simple HTML & CSS project), I can help you write a fun little **music or summary** just about that.

Hereâ€™s a short and catchy version of a **music-style summary** for your **2-page HTML & CSS website**:

---

ðŸŽ¶ **"Just Two Pages, But I Shine"** ðŸŽ¶
*(Mini music-style summary)*

**\[Verse]**
Just two pages, simple and clean,
HTML frames it, CSS brings the sheen.
Home is the welcome, with colors so bright,
Next page flows, everything's right.

**\[Chorus]**
ðŸŽµ Two pages, thatâ€™s my start,
Coded with love, coded with heart.
HTML bones, CSS skin,
Even with two â€” Iâ€™m built to win! ðŸŽµ

**\[Outro]**
Small in size, big in style,
These pages walk the extra mile.
From tags to styles, Iâ€™ve done my part,
Web dev dreams â€” this is my art.

If you'd like, I can help you generate the **actual HTML and CSS code** for both pages and even show how to link them together with a simple navigation.

Just tell me:

* What are the **two pages**? (e.g., Home and About? Home and Contact?)
* Do you want a specific **theme or topic** (like food, travel, portfolio)?
* Do you want it to be **responsive** or just basic?

Let me know and Iâ€™ll help you build it step by step ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’»
